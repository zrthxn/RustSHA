# RustSHA
This is a noob implementation of the SHA256 algorithm in Rust. Why? Because I can. And it gives me a chance 
to feel ***hackerboi.***

### Usage
You're probably better off using an in-built crypto library. But if you do use this, please don't blame me 
if real Russian hackers steal your data.
