# RustSHA
This is a noob implementation of SHA256 in Rust. Why? Because I can. A chance
to feel ***hackerboi.*** (and ofc a learning experience).

***Zero Dependencies***

### Usage
You're probably better off using an in-built crypto library. But if you do use this, please don't blame me
if Russian hackers steal your data.
